Evaluation Plot
===============

The evaluation plot can be automatically generated by the ``PySS3 Command Line`` tool using any of the following commands:

* :code:`save evaluations` --- saves the interactive plot in a single and portable HTML file ("ss3_model_evaluation[*model_name*].html") in the current directory.

* :code:`plot evaluations` --- not only saves the plot but also opens it up in your web browser.


As shown in the figure below, in this plot, each data point represents an evaluation/experiment performed using a particular combinations of hyperparameter values (``s``, ``l`` and ``p``). These points are colored, using the viridis colormap, in relation to how good the performance was. The points with the global best performance are marked in pink.

.. note:: two live examples of these evaluation plots are `"Movie Review (Sentiment Analysis)" <../_static/ss3_model_evaluation[movie_review_3grams].html>`__ and `"Topic Categorization" <../_static/ss3_model_evaluation[topic_categorization_3grams].html>`__, both were obtained following the :ref:`tutorials`.

The performance measure can be interactively changed using the options panel in the upper-left corner, as shown below.

When you move the cursor over a data point, information related to that evaluation is shown, including a "compact" version of the obtained confusion matrix.

And when k-fold cross-validation is used, it is shown the confusion matrix obtained in each fold. For example, the following image shows a data point for a 10-fold cross-validation evaluation:

Additionally, when you click a data point, a list of useful commands for the ``PySS3 Command Line`` is shown, as shown below.

.. image:: ../_static/evaluation-click.gif


Finally, using the options panel you can hide and show different parts of the plot. For instance, if you simply want to see the performance "pattern" in terms of the three hyperparameters, you can use "show volume" option as show below:  

.. image:: ../_static/evaluation-hover-volume.gif

This will allow you to better analyze the relationship between hyperparameters and performance.
