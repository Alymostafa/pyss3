************
The Workflow
************

PySS3 provides two main types of workflow: classic and "command line". Both workflows are briefly described below.

.. _classic-workflow:
Classic Workflow
================

As usual, importing the needed classes and functions from the package, the user writes a python script to train and test the classifiers. In this workflow, user can use the `PySS3 Command Line` to perform model selection (though hyperparameter optimization). 


.. _pyss3-workflow:
Command-Line Workflow
=====================

The whole process is done using only the `PySS3 Command Line`. This workflow provides a faster way to perform experimentations since the user doesn't have to write any python script. Plus, this Command Line tool allows the user to actively interact  "on the fly" with the models being developed.


Note: :ref:`tutorials` are presented in two versions, one for each workflow type, so that the reader can choose the workflow that best suit her/his needs.
